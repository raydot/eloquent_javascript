# Chapter 4: Data Structures, Objects and Arrays

### Ideas For Further Futzing

    * Convert chapter code to ES6 (lots of FOR loops, for example)
    * Can the algorithms be optimized?  The journalEvents function has an O of n<sup>2</sup>, for instance, but it loops through the events long after all of them are found.
    * Add real Jade test cases to ex_reverseArray.js and ex_sumFunction.js.
