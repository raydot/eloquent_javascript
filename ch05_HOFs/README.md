# Chapter 5: Higher-Order Functions

Looks like I originally tried to follow this chapter from HTML and not Node. Leaving that code in place but it's pretty worthless.

"It is a useful skill, in programming, to notice when you are working at too low a level of abstraction."

## Chapter Summary

This chapter covers
*   forEach (loop over elements in array)
*   filter (returns new array matching elements that pass predicate function)
*   map (transforms an array by putting each element through a function)
*   reduce (combine all elements in an array into a single value)
*   some (tests whether any element matches a given predicate function)
*   findIndex (finds the position of the first element that matches a predicate)
