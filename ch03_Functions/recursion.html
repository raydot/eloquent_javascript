	<p>Consider this puzzle: by starting from the number 1 and repeatedly
	either adding 5 or multiplying by 3, an infinite amount of new numbers
	can be produced.  How would you write a function that, given a number,
	tries to find a sequence of such additions and multiplications that
	produces that number?  Eg: 13 can be reached by multiplying by 3 and
	adding 5 twice, 15 cannot be reached at all.</p>
